### W&B Set-Up

- Public W&B project `nyc_airbnb`

	Your W&B project nyc_airbnb should be made public, so that your reviewer can access it. This is needed so the reviewer can check that the W&B steps have been executed successfully.

   Make sure the link to your W&B project, as well as your GitHub repository (i.e. two links), are included in a `README` file or given to the reviewer in the "Submission Details" box you can use when initiating the submission process.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Obtain sample data
	
   There is a `sample.csv` artifact in W&B.

   The pipeline has been run to get a sample of the data, which has been uploaded to W&B.


### Data Cleaning

- Update all parameters
	
   Add docstrings and the proper type to all parameters in the `run.py` script.

- Run basic_cleaning without errors
	
   The `basic_cleaning` step should be added to the `main.py` file and run without errors.

   In the `main.py` file all parameters are taken from the configuration file, and not hard-coded.

- Create clean_data.csv in W&B
	
   At the end of the run of this step, there should be a `clean_data.csv` artifact uploaded to W&B.


### Data Testing

- Create a “reference” tag for the latest version of the `clean_sample.csv` artifact
	
   In W&B, manually add a tag called “reference” to the latest version of the `clean_sample.csv` artifact.

- Implement the `test_row_count` and the `test_price_range` tests in `src/data_check/test_data.py`
	
   Implements the `test_row_count` and the `test_price_range` tests in `src/data_check/test_data.py`.

   The added tests are checking respectively for a proper size of the dataset, and for a proper price range.

- The pipeline runs successfully
	
   The pipeline runs after this step, and all the tests pass.


### Data Splitting

- Split data into training, validation and test sets.
	
   Adds the `train_val_test_split` component to the `main.py` file.

   The `train_val_test_split` has been provided to you. You can just add it to the `main.py` file and fill in the parameters appropriately.

- The pipeline again runs successfully
	
   The pipeline runs. At the end there should be 2 new artifacts on W&B: `trainval_data.csv`, `test_data.csv`.


### Train the Random Forest

- Complete the `src/train_random_forest/run.py` script
	
   The `src/train_random_forest/run.py` script is completed.

   When checking the script, there should be the following steps in the script, marked by clear comments:

      1. In the get_inference_pipeline function, implement a pipeline called `non_ordinal_categorical_preproc` with two steps: a `SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")` and a `OneHotEncoder()` step
      2. In the `get_inference_pipeline` function, create the inference pipeline called `sk_pipe` containing the preprocessing step and the Random Forest
      3. In the go function, fit the pipeline.
      4. In the go function, save the pipeline using MLFlow model export.
      5. Log the variable MAE to W&B

- The pipeline again runs successfully
	
   The pipeline again runs successfully.

   The `train_random_forest` step is added to the `main.py` file.

- Create the model_export artifact on W&B
	
   There should be an artifact created on W&B called `model_export`.

   The model_export artifact should contain a MLflow sklearn serialized model.


### Optimize Hyperparameters

- Run training with different hyperparameters
	
   Using the Hydra system, run a hyper-parameter search.

   On W&B there should be the results of several (>2) training jobs with different hyperparameters.


### Select the Best Model

- Select the best performing model and tag it as “prod”
	
   Add the tag “prod” to the trained model with the best MAE.


### Test Set Verification

- Verify test set performance is comparable to performance on the validation set (no overfitting)
	
   Implement the `test_regression_model` function in the `main.py` file. The `test_regression_model` is provided just as in the “data splitting” step.

   Verify that the performance is comparable to what was obtained against the validation set (i.e. no overfitting occurred).


### Visualize the Pipeline

- Visualize the pipeline and verify proper structure
	
   Navigate to W&B, to the artifact section, then click on “Graph view”. The resulting visualization should show the pipeline properly organized. Refer to the reference plot in the instruction.


### Release the Pipeline

- Release v1.0.0 of the pipeline in GitHub
	
   A release of the pipeline is cut from the GitHub repository, with version 1.0.0 or similar (if you need more trials, you might assign versions like 1.0.1 or 1.0.2, which is totally fine).


### Train the Model on a New Data Sample

- Run the released pipeline on a new sample of data, with initial failure
	
   Run the released pipeline on a new sample of data, `sample2.csv`. The first version 1.0.0 (or similar) should fail, because there is a data problem in `sample2.csv`.

- Add a new cleaning step in `basic_cleaning`
	
   Implement a new cleaning step that removes data points that are outside of the area of NYC in `basic_cleaning`.

- Prepare a new release
	
   After adding the new cleaning step and committing and pushing to the repository, release a new version (for example, 1.0.1).

- Run the new release successfully
	
   Re-running with the new release should produce a new trained model.
